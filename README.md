# loan-approval-status

This project is on loan approval status as the name suggests, 
where we are given some data which included marraige status, education, self employed, loan amount.

First commit was for how to simply apply a Machine learning algorithm, pickle it and use <b>FastAPI</b> to serve it

Further plan for this project is to containarize the project using docker and serve it from a container and also apply different algorithms and improve the accuracy.
